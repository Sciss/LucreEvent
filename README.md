# LucreEvent

## statement

LucreEvent provides a reactive event and observer layer for LucreSTM, a software transactional memory and persistence library for the Scala programming language. The reactive system implements event graphs which also can be persistent, along with live observers. A sub module adds an provides an expression tree system.

## requirements / installation

LucreEvent builds with sbt 0.12 against Scala 2.10 (default) and 2.9.2. It depends on [LucreSTM](https://github.com/Sciss/LucreSTM) and on [LucreData](https://github.com/Sciss/LucreData) which should be automatically found by sbt.

## linking

The projects is divided into a `core` module (just the event layer) and an `expr` module (the expression tree layer). The following dependency is necessary:

    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent" % "1.6.+"

Or just for the core:

    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent-core" % "1.6.+"

And for the expression layer:

    resolvers += "Oracle Repository" at "http://download.oracle.com/maven"

    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent-expr" % "1.6.+"

## documentation

At the moment, there are only sparse API documentation, which is generated by `sbt doc`. The basic concept:

TODO!

 - The system distinguishes between persisted and live references (even with a pure in-memory system), where a change in an observed object is propagated through a mechanism called 'tunnelling', pushing along stub nodes until a live node is found, which in turn evaluates the path in pull fashion.

## creating an IntelliJ IDEA project

To develop the sources of this library, we recommend IntelliJ IDEA. If you haven't globally installed the sbt-idea plugin yet, create the following contents in `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.2.0")

Then to create the IDEA project, run `sbt gen-idea`.
