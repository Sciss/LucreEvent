## statement

LucreEvent provides a reactive event and observer layer for LucreSTM, a software transactional memory and persistence library for the Scala programming language. The reactive system implements event graphs which also can be persistent, along with live observers. A sub module adds an provides an expression tree system.

## requirements / installation

LucreEvent builds with sbt 0.13 against Scala 2.11, 2.10. It depends on [LucreSTM](https://github.com/Sciss/LucreSTM) and on [LucreData](https://github.com/Sciss/LucreData) which should be automatically found by sbt.

## linking

The projects is divided into a `core` module (just the event layer) and an `expr` module (the expression tree layer). The following dependency is necessary:

    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent" % v

Or for each layer:

    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent-core"     % v
    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent-expr"     % v
    "de.sciss" %% "lucreevent-artifact" % v

Note that `expr` requires the following additional resolver:

    resolvers += "Oracle Repository" at "http://download.oracle.com/maven"

The current version `v` is `"2.7.5"`.

## documentation

At the moment, there are only sparse API documentation, which is generated by `sbt doc`. The basic concept:

TODO!

 - The system distinguishes between persisted and live references (even with a pure in-memory system), where a change in an observed object is propagated through a mechanism called 'tunnelling', pushing along stub nodes until a live node is found, which in turn evaluates the path in pull fashion.
